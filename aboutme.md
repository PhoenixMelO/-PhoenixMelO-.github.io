### My story

I joined the Marines when I was 17 years old. I served 13 years active duty. I finished the rest of my service as a reservist. I owned a business for a year inside of a gym. I sold supplements and made custom protein shakes. I have done fitness competitions. I have a BA in Cultural Anthropology. I am working on my MS in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics.

--- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.---
